# Web-Monitoring-Tool 1.0

The World Wide Web provides potentially relevant information through a
variety of channels and sources for answering diverse issues and questions.

Web can be supported by Web Monitoring Tools. The prototype applies
modern frontend and backend Web technologies such as AngularJS, Flask
